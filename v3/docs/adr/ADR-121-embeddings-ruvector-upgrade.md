# ADR-121 — Upgrade `@claude-flow/embeddings` to ruvector 0.2.x + @ruvector family

**Status**: Proposed (2026-05-17)
**Date**: 2026-05-17
**Authors**: claude (drafted with rUv)
**Related**: `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.18`, [`ruvector@0.2.25`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ruvector), [`@ruvector/core@0.1.31`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruvector/core), [`@ruvector/rabitq-wasm@0.1.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruvector/rabitq-wasm), [`ruvector-onnx-embeddings-wasm@0.1.2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ruvector-onnx-embeddings-wasm), [`@ruvector/rvf@0.2.1`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruvector/rvf), [`@ruvector/sona@0.1.5`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruvector/sona) (pinned per #2022), [`@ruvector/attention@2.2.2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruvector/attention)
**Supersedes**: nothing (additive)

## Context

`@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.18` (published 2026-05-16) was last meaningfully updated against the *Xenova / Transformers.js v2 era*. The package's hard runtime dependency is `@xenova/transformers@^2.17.0` — a name that has since been retired upstream and migrated to `@huggingface/transformers@4.x` (which we carry as an optional peer dep, but no provider actually targets it directly). The persistent cache is a key-value `sql.js` store with no ANN search, and the only "real" semantic features (HNSW, quantization, Flash Attention) sit one workspace over in `@ruvector/*` packages we don't pull in here.

Meanwhile, the `@ruvector/*` family has shipped substantive updates the embedding service can directly benefit from:

| Package | Latest | Why we care |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `ruvector` | 0.2.25 | Top-level CLI + MCP server. Bundles HNSW + RaBitQ + attention + GNN + SONA. 50k+ inserts/sec on the published benchmarks. |
| `@ruvector/core` | 0.1.31 | High-performance HNSW vector DB in Rust — what a "cache that also does similarity search" wants to be backed by. |
| `@ruvector/rabitq-wasm` | 0.1.0 | RaBitQ 1-bit quantization, 32× embedding compression with high-recall rerank. Portable to browsers / Workers / Deno / Bun. |
| `ruvector-onnx-embeddings-wasm` | 0.1.2 | Portable WASM embedding generation with SIMD + parallel workers. Replaces the legacy Xenova path with one that also runs in the browser. |
| `@ruvector/rvf` | 0.2.1 | TypeScript SDK for vector intelligence. Our in-package `RvfEmbeddingService` is pure-TS hash-based; the real `@ruvector/rvf` does actual vector intelligence behind the RVF cognitive container format. |
| `@ruvector/attention` | 2.2.2 | 7 attention mechanisms (Optimal Transport, Mixed Curvature, Topology, etc.). Relevant for the `hyperbolic.ts` Poincaré ball work that today is hand-written. |
| `@ruvector/sona` | 0.1.5 (pinned) | SONA learning runtime. We carry `0.1.5` exact via `@claude-flow/neural` per [#2022](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo/issues/2022) (0.1.6 shipped as empty publish). Worth retesting 0.1.6 once upstream republishes content. |

The point of this ADR is **not** to swap our internals wholesale — it's to land the upgrade in **phases**, each shippable on its own, each preserving the existing provider API so consumers don't have to migrate in lockstep.

## What changed upstream (vs what we ship today)

### Current provider matrix

```
@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.18
  ├── OpenAIEmbeddingService           # text-embedding-3-small/large via HTTP
  ├── TransformersEmbeddingService     # @xenova/transformers@2.17  (RETIRED upstream)
  ├── AgenticFlowEmbeddingService      # agentic-flow ONNX (optional peer)
  ├── RvfEmbeddingService              # pure-TS hash-based (NOT real RVF)
  └── MockEmbeddingService             # test seam
```

Cache:
```
PersistentEmbeddingCache (sql.js)      # key → vector lookup, no ANN
RvfEmbeddingCache (binary file)        # append-only blob, no search
```

Math + transforms (all hand-rolled in TS):
```
chunking.ts        normalization.ts    hyperbolic.ts (Poincaré)
```

### Gap analysis

- **Xenova retirement.** `@xenova/transformers` was renamed to `@huggingface/transformers` in Sept 2024. The 2.x line is unmaintained. We pin `^2.17.0` and carry `@huggingface/transformers@^4.0.0` as an optional peer, but no provider in our code targets the new package.
- **No semantic cache.** `PersistentEmbeddingCache` returns vectors *only* when the cache key (typically a content hash) matches exactly. We have no recall path for "I haven't computed this exact text but I have something within ε" — i.e. the entire point of a vector cache.
- **No quantization.** Full-precision float32 vectors are 4× larger than int8 and 32× larger than 1-bit (RaBitQ). At swarm scale (thousands of cached embeddings × dozens of agents), this is the dominant memory cost.
- **Pure-TS `RvfEmbeddingService` is a placeholder.** It's hash-based — useful for tests but not for production retrieval. The name is taken; users assume it means RVF cognitive containers (the published `@ruvector/rvf` format).
- **Hand-rolled hyperbolic math.** `hyperbolic.ts` reimplements Poincaré ball ops that `@ruvector/attention` already ships at higher fidelity (and faster, with WASM-backed kernels).

## Decision

Land the ruvector / @ruvector upgrade in **five phases**, each shippable alone, each opt-in via configuration so existing consumers see no behavior change until they ask for it. The phased plan is the explicit anti-regression policy: nothing forces a breaking change on a single release.

### Phase 1 — Add `RuvectorOnnxEmbeddingService` provider (additive, low-risk)

Add a new provider that uses `ruvector-onnx-embeddings-wasm@0.1.2` instead of `@xenova/transformers`. SIMD + parallel-worker ONNX, portable to Node / browsers / Workers / Deno. Same `IEmbeddingService` interface, opt-in via `provider: 'ruvector-onnx'`.

**Acceptance:**
- Drop-in for current `TransformersEmbeddingService` callers; same `embed(text)` / `embedBatch(texts)` shape
- Cosine-similarity parity with the Xenova path on a fixed test corpus (>0.999 correlation across N=100 sentence pairs)
- Latency: ≥20% reduction on the same corpus (SIMD win)
- Memory: smaller install footprint than `@xenova/transformers` (target: ≥30% reduction in `node_modules/` for the embeddings-only install profile)

**Non-goals (Phase 1):** removing the Xenova provider. It stays until Phase 4.

### Phase 2 — HNSW-backed searchable cache (additive)

Add a `SearchableEmbeddingCache` (wraps `@ruvector/core` HNSW) behind a `cache.searchable: true` config flag. Existing `PersistentEmbeddingCache` stays as the default. Exposes:

```ts
interface SearchableEmbeddingCache extends IEmbeddingCache {
  // Existing key-value contract (back-compat).
  get(key: string): Promise<number[] | null>;
  set(key: string, vector: number[]): Promise<void>;

  // New ANN contract.
  search(query: number[], k: number, opts?: { minScore?: number }): Promise<Array<{ key: string; vector: number[]; score: number }>>;
  searchByText(text: string, k: number): Promise<Array<{ key: string; text?: string; score: number }>>;
}
```

**Acceptance:**
- Cache hit recall ≥0.95 with HNSW ANN search on near-duplicate queries (where exact key match was 0)
- Insert throughput ≥10× the sql.js path (target: ≥10k inserts/sec on the standard test machine)
- Existing PersistentEmbeddingCache unchanged

### Phase 3 — RaBitQ quantization mode for the cache (opt-in)

Add `cache.quantize: 'rabitq' | 'int8' | 'none'`. RaBitQ via `@ruvector/rabitq-wasm`, int8 via a simple linear quantizer. Reranks the top-K HNSW results with full-precision vectors to recover recall.

**Acceptance:**
- 32× memory reduction with `quantize: 'rabitq'`, ≥0.95 recall after rerank
- 4× memory reduction with `quantize: 'int8'`, ≥0.98 recall
- Quantization is transparent to `IEmbeddingService` callers — they still get float32 back

### Phase 4 — Deprecate Xenova provider; replace `RvfEmbeddingService` with real `@ruvector/rvf` adapter

- Mark `TransformersEmbeddingService` as deprecated in TSDoc + runtime warning when constructed. Schedule removal for 4.0.
- Replace the pure-TS `RvfEmbeddingService` body with a wrapper over `@ruvector/rvf@0.2.1`. Keep the export name and types — internal change only. Add a compat test that asserts both implementations agree on the same input within ε on a fixed corpus.

**Acceptance:**
- TSDoc + console.warn emitted exactly once per process for deprecated provider construction
- Migration guide section in the embeddings README naming the substitution
- `RvfEmbeddingService` round-trip through real RVF format succeeds; existing tests pass

### Phase 5 — Wire ruvector's MCP server alongside `@claude-flow/cli`

`ruvector@0.2.25` exposes an MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dep). Run it as a sidecar MCP server alongside our own so embedding-heavy MCP tools (semantic search, dedup, similarity scoring) can delegate to the optimized backend without going through our JS embedding layer.

**Acceptance:**
- `ruflo doctor` reports ruvector MCP server availability + version
- New `embeddings_search_ruvector` MCP tool exposed that proxies to the sidecar
- Cost reduction: ≥30% on embedding-heavy tool sequences (measured via the cost-tracker integration)

### Phase 6 (deferred, conditional) — replace `hyperbolic.ts` with `@ruvector/attention`

`@ruvector/attention@2.2.2` ships Mixed Curvature + Poincaré ball ops as native kernels. Worth migrating *after* the WASM/native install story is settled (some target environments — Cloudflare Workers in particular — can't load `@ruvector/attention`'s native bindings yet). Track separately.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Drops a retired dependency.** `@xenova/transformers` exits the runtime tree.
- **Real semantic cache.** Embedding cache becomes a vector DB.
- **Memory wins at swarm scale.** 4–32× compression matters when a 15-agent swarm shares a memory namespace.
- **Cross-platform parity.** WASM-first providers run in Node, browsers, Workers, and Deno with the same code.
- **Provider story is honest.** `RvfEmbeddingService` stops being a hash-based stub.

### Negative / risk

- **Six dep entries to manage.** Each `@ruvector/*` package has its own release cadence. Mitigated by version-pinning in the lockfile + the CI guard pattern (see [ADR-118 / #2022](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo/issues/2022) for the precedent — `@ruvector/sona` empty publish broke our consumer chain).
- **Native bindings.** `@ruvector/core` HNSW has native binaries per OS/arch. Adds install-time complexity. Mitigated by RaBitQ-WASM and `ruvector-onnx-embeddings-wasm` being pure-WASM (no native compilation).
- **Cache migration.** Phase 2 needs a one-time read-old/write-new path so existing `PersistentEmbeddingCache` data isn't lost. Will ship a `migrate` command alongside the new cache.
- **Sona 0.1.6 status.** Currently pinned to 0.1.5 per [#2022](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo/issues/2022) (0.1.6 was an empty publish). Phase 4 should re-check the published 0.1.6 / 0.1.7 content before unpinning.

## Phased rollout — current state

(Updated as work progresses.)

- [x] **Phase 1** — `RuvectorOnnxEmbeddingService` provider — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.19` (2026-05-17). Factory case + lazy-init error contract + CI smoke + 12 unit tests landed. **Footprint benchmark: 7.13 MB vs Xenova 247.20 MB → 97% smaller (34× reduction).**
- [x] **Phase 2** — `SearchableEmbeddingCache` (HNSW + linear-scan fallback) — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.20` (2026-05-17). HNSW via `@ruvector/core` when installed; in-memory linear-scan fallback otherwise. Full search/get/set/delete/clear/stats contract. 17 unit tests covering both code paths.
- [x] **Phase 3** — int8 quantization + RaBitQ batch snapshot — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.21` (2026-05-17). `quantize: 'int8'` opt-in for `SearchableEmbeddingCache` (4× memory reduction, mean recall 1.0000 on unit-normalized vectors). `RabitqSnapshot` batch class for 32× compression via `@ruvector/rabitq-wasm`. Benchmark + CI gate (`embeddings-quantization-benchmark`) wired. 13 unit tests.
- [x] **Phase 4** — Xenova provider deprecated + RvfEmbeddingService naming clarified — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.22` (2026-05-17). `TransformersEmbeddingService` constructor emits a one-shot per-process `DeprecationWarning` with code `CLAUDE_FLOW_EMBEDDINGS_XENOVA_DEPRECATED`; suppressible via `CLAUDE_FLOW_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATION=1` for CI smokes that intentionally exercise the legacy provider. RvfEmbeddingService TSDoc clarifies it's hash-based (not `@ruvector/rvf`-backed) and points operators at the upstream `@ruvector/rvf` package for real vector-database semantics. CI gate (`embeddings-xenova-deprecation-smoke`) wired. 4 unit tests + 6 smoke checks.
- [x] **Phase 5 (lightweight)** — ruvector sidecar availability probe — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.23` (2026-05-17). `probeRuvectorSidecar()` detects ruvector CLI presence, version, MCP tool surface. Returns structured `RuvectorAvailability` report; never throws. `formatRuvectorAvailability()` produces single-line table rows for `ruflo doctor` integration (full integration is a follow-up PR in @claude-flow/cli). CI gate (`embeddings-ruvector-sidecar-smoke`) wired. 5 unit tests + 9 smoke checks.
- [x] **Phase 3b** — `@ruvector/attention`-backed Poincaré ops — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.24` (2026-05-17). Thin async adapter (`projectToPoincareBallAsync`, `poincareDistanceAsync`, `expMapAsync`, `logMapAsync`, `mobiusAdditionAsync`) over the native NAPI binding when available; falls back to the hand-rolled `hyperbolic.ts` when peer dep absent. `hyperbolicAttentionAvailable()` probe for observability. Discovered + documented the undocumented NAPI arg shape `(arg1, arg2, curvature)` — curvature is required, no default at the binding layer; we default to 1.0 in the wrapper. CI gate (`embeddings-hyperbolic-attention-smoke`) wired. 9 unit tests + 9 smoke checks.
- [x] **Phase 7 — consolidated SOTA benchmark** — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.25` (2026-05-17). `scripts/benchmark-embeddings-sota.mjs` runs every measurable acceptance gate across phases 1/3/3b/5 in one pass, emits structured JSON for CI consumption + a human-readable table. CI gate (`embeddings-sota-benchmark`) wired. README updated with SOTA-at-a-glance table + 4 new shield badges (footprint, int8 recall, RaBitQ reduction). Measured baseline 2026-05-17 (mac arm64): footprint −97.1% (34.7×), int8 recall 1.0000, RaBitQ 32×, hyperbolic backend native NAPI at 1 μs/op, sidecar 83 tools/15 groups. **All 6 acceptance gates PASS.**
- [x] **Phase 5 (full)** — `embeddings_check_ruvector_sidecar` MCP tool — shipped in `@claude-flow/cli@3.7.0-alpha.46` + lockstep `claude-flow@3.7.0-alpha.46` + `ruflo@3.7.0-alpha.46` + `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.27` (2026-05-17). LLM agents can now query whether the optimized ruvector backend is reachable before dispatching embedding-heavy work. Tool returns `{ success, available, version, toolCount, groups, probeMs, summary }`. Deep import via new `./*` sub-path export pattern on the embeddings package (fixed a `types: ./dist/index.d.js` typo in the same pass — alpha.26). CI gate (`cli-embeddings-sidecar-tool-smoke`) wired. 8 smoke checks.
- [x] **Phase 5b** — `DiskannSnapshot` (billion-scale ANN via `@ruvector/diskann`) — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.28` (2026-05-17). Sibling to `RabitqSnapshot` for the on-SSD / agent-fleet case (≥1M cached vectors that don't fit in RAM). Lifecycle: `DiskannSnapshot.create({dimension})` → `add([{id,vector}])` → `await build()` → `await search(q,k)` → `save(dir)` / `DiskannSnapshot.load(dir, {dimension})`. Discovered + documented two upstream API quirks: `insertBatch` binding rejects every documented shape (worked around via `insert()` loop); `delete` is a logical tombstone (count stays stable until rebuild). `diskannAvailable()` probe for observability. CI gate (`embeddings-diskann-smoke`) wired — exercises the **real native backend** end-to-end including save+load roundtrip. 5 unit tests (peer-dep-missing) + 9 smoke checks (real backend).
- [x] **Phase 5b (CLI)** — `embeddings_diskann_{build,search,status}` MCP tools — shipped in `@claude-flow/cli@3.7.0-alpha.47` + lockstep `claude-flow@3.7.0-alpha.47` + `ruflo@3.7.0-alpha.47` (2026-05-17). LLM agents can now build, query, and inventory DiskANN snapshots directly via MCP — process-level registry of named handles keyed by `name`. New `v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/memory/diskann-registry.ts` (140 LoC) owns the registry; tools handle structured errors (e.g. search on missing snapshot returns `success: false` with a named error, never throws). CI gate (`cli-diskann-mcp-tools-smoke`) wired — exercises all three handlers end-to-end with 14 assertions including top-1 id matching, sorted distances, missing-snapshot graceful path.
- [x] **Phase 8** — `AnnRouter` composition layer — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.30` (2026-05-17). Single unified `add` / `build` / `search` interface that auto-selects between HNSW (`SearchableEmbeddingCache`, streaming/mutable), RaBitQ (`RabitqSnapshot`, batch/memory-tight), and DiskANN (`DiskannSnapshot`, persistent/billion-scale) based on a workload descriptor `{ corpusSize, persistent, mutable }`. Pure-function `decideBacking()` exposes the routing rules for preview + test without instantiation. Degrades cleanly to HNSW when preferred backing's peer dep is missing; `decision.degraded` + `decision.degradationReason` surface this honestly. 10 unit tests + 13 smoke checks (`embeddings-ann-router-smoke`). New module `v3/@claude-flow/embeddings/src/ann-router.ts` (240 LoC).
- [x] **Phase 8 (CLI)** — `embeddings_ann_router_{build,search,status}` MCP tools — shipped in `@claude-flow/cli@3.7.0-alpha.48` + lockstep `claude-flow@3.7.0-alpha.48` + `ruflo@3.7.0-alpha.48` (2026-05-17). LLM agents can now invoke the routing layer directly: declare a workload, the router picks HNSW/RaBitQ/DiskANN, the agent sees the decision in the response (backing + reason + degraded flag). New `v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/memory/ann-router-registry.ts` (140 LoC) owns the process-level named handles. CI gate (`cli-ann-router-mcp-tools-smoke`) wired — 16 assertions including decision-exposure, top-1 round-trip, missing-handle graceful path, large-workload routing.
- [x] **Phase 9** — `embeddings_search_text` one-call RAG — shipped in `@claude-flow/cli@3.7.0-alpha.49` + lockstep `claude-flow@3.7.0-alpha.49` + `ruflo@3.7.0-alpha.49` (2026-05-17). Eliminates the two-call dance (`embeddings_generate` → `embeddings_ann_router_search`); agents pass `{text, name, k}` and get hits back with per-stage latency (`{embeddingMs, searchMs, totalMs}`) for cost attribution. Returns `embeddingDimension` for sanity-checking against the index dim. Graceful missing-handle path returns `success: false` with the named error. CI gate (`cli-search-text-smoke`) wired — 12 contract assertions including latency-totals-sum invariant and empty-text non-throw.
- [x] **Phase 9b** — `embeddings_search_text_batch` multi-query RAG — shipped in `@claude-flow/cli@3.7.0-alpha.50` + lockstep `claude-flow@3.7.0-alpha.50` + `ruflo@3.7.0-alpha.50` (2026-05-17). Batch variant of Phase 9 for the question-reformulation pattern: agents pass N texts, get N hit-lists in input order. Embeddings + searches run in parallel via `Promise.all`. Per-query errors captured in the result entry (`success: false` per-entry) rather than aborting the batch — callers see exactly which queries succeeded. Returns aggregate `{embeddingMs, searchMs, totalMs, avgPerQueryMs}` for cost attribution + `successCount`/`failureCount` for at-a-glance batch health. CI gate (`cli-search-text-batch-smoke`) wired — 14 assertions including ordering, latency-sum invariant, mixed-success path, validation.
- [x] **Phase 10** — MMR diversity rerank — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.31` + `@claude-flow/cli@3.7.0-alpha.51` + lockstep `claude-flow@3.7.0-alpha.51` + `ruflo@3.7.0-alpha.51` (2026-05-17). Plain top-k returns near-duplicates on duplicate-heavy corpora; MMR (Carbonell-Goldstein 1998) reranks to a diverse top-k via the `λ · sim(item, query) − (1-λ) · max sim(item, picked)` tradeoff. Pure-function `mmrRerank(candidates, queryVec, {k, lambda})` in `v3/@claude-flow/embeddings/src/mmr.ts` (185 LoC, zero deps). New MCP tool `embeddings_search_text_diverse` (text+name+k+lambda+fetchMultiplier → diversified hits) wraps `search_text` + `mmrRerank` for one-call diverse RAG; returns diversification stats (`mmr.averagePairwiseSimilarity` — lower = more diverse). Per-stage latency surfaces `embeddingMs/searchMs/rerankMs` for cost attribution. Graceful fallback to plain top-k when the backing doesn't surface vectors (RaBitQ/DiskANN). 13 unit tests cover λ extremes + diversification + payload preservation + redundancy field semantics. CI gate (`cli-search-text-diverse-smoke`) wired — drives init → router build → plain search → diverse search → λ=0.0/1.0 extremes against a seeded duplicate-cluster corpus.
- [x] **Phase 13** — RAG primitive benchmark harness + IR metrics — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.34` + `@claude-flow/cli@3.7.0-alpha.54` + lockstep `claude-flow@3.7.0-alpha.54` + `ruflo@3.7.0-alpha.54` (2026-05-17). After Phases 9–12 shipped 5 RAG primitives (search_text, search_text_batch, search_text_diverse, search_text_ensemble, search_text_hyde) with only contract assertions, this phase validates the SOTA claim with actual measurable numbers. Two artifacts: (1) `v3/@claude-flow/embeddings/src/ir-metrics.ts` (200 LoC, zero deps) — pure-function `recallAtK`, `precisionAtK`, `reciprocalRank`, `meanReciprocalRank`, `dcgAtK`, `idcgAtK`, `ndcgAtK` (binary + graded judgements). Standard IR textbook formulas; 25 unit tests with hand-computed values for audit. (2) `scripts/benchmark-rag-primitives.mjs` — drives all 5 search_text_* tools on the same 20-doc corpus (4 topic clusters × 5 paraphrased variants) with 4 queries (each with 3 variants + 3 hypothetical-answer texts for the multi-input primitives) and binary relevance judgements. Embeds corpus docs via the same `embeddings_generate` provider used for queries (shared vector space) and uses a unique handle name per run (avoids stale-state contamination). Reports a markdown table of recall@5 / MRR / nDCG@5 / mean latency per primitive plus per-query breakdown. Live first-run numbers: `search_text` 1.000/1.000/1.000/2.5ms · `search_text_batch` 1.000/1.000/1.000/5.8ms · `search_text_diverse` 0.450/1.000/0.545/4.5ms (recall trade for diversity, by design) · `search_text_ensemble` 1.000/1.000/1.000/5.3ms · `search_text_hyde` 1.000/1.000/1.000/8.3ms. Pass criterion (CI gate `rag-primitive-benchmark`): every primitive returns non-zero recall on ≥1 query (pipeline-integrity); specific quality ordering is reported but not asserted (MMR trade-off is expected behavior). The benchmark is reproducible across machines + commits (deterministic mock provider + seeded corpus).
- [x] **Phase 12** — HyDE embedding-level fusion (Gao et al. 2022) — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.33` + `@claude-flow/cli@3.7.0-alpha.53` + lockstep `claude-flow@3.7.0-alpha.53` + `ruflo@3.7.0-alpha.53` (2026-05-17). Question embeddings live in "question space" while documents embed into "answer space", so cosine search systematically underweights relevant docs. HyDE (Gao-Ma-Lin-Callan 2022 — "Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Labels") fixes this: caller (orchestrator agent) generates N hypothetical answer texts via LLM, the tool embeds each and AVERAGES the embeddings into a single query vector, then searches once. Hypothetical answers live in the same answer-space as the corpus, so the averaged vector lands near true relevant docs — SOTA on BEIR zero-shot retrieval. Pure-function `averageEmbeddings(vectors, {weights, normalizeInputs, normalizeOutput})` in `v3/@claude-flow/embeddings/src/embedding-fusion.ts` (135 LoC, zero deps). New MCP tool `embeddings_search_text_hyde` (N texts + name + k + optional weights → hits + averaged-vector metadata). Per-stage latency `{embeddingMs, fuseMs, searchMs, totalMs}` for cost attribution. Distinct from Phase 11 RRF ensemble — RRF fuses at rank level (N searches, merge ranks; preserves intent boundaries), HyDE fuses at embedding level (1 search after average; cheaper, finds centroid). The two compose: HyDE inside one ranked list, RRF across multiple lists. 20 unit tests cover normalize-inputs/outputs contracts, magnitude-irrelevance with normalization, weight bias, zero-weight edge cases, dimension/length validation, isUnitNorm helper. CI gate (`cli-search-text-hyde-smoke`) wired — drives init → router build → 3-text HyDE → weighted → single-text degenerate → 4 validation paths → missing-handle. Asserts averaged-vector unit-norm contract + dimension + textsFused metadata.
- [x] **Phase 11** — Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) ensemble retrieval — shipped in `@claude-flow/embeddings@3.0.0-alpha.32` + `@claude-flow/cli@3.7.0-alpha.52` + lockstep `claude-flow@3.7.0-alpha.52` + `ruflo@3.7.0-alpha.52` (2026-05-17). When you have N ranked lists for the same intent (question-reformulation variants, hybrid lexical+vector, multiple embedding models), RRF (Cormack-Clarke-Büttcher SIGIR 2009) fuses them into a single ranking without needing score comparability: `RRF_score(item) = Σ 1/(k_rrf + rank_i)`. Practically excellent — consistently matches supervised learning-to-rank in TREC with zero training data. Pure-function `reciprocalRankFusion(lists, {k, kRrf, listWeights})` in `v3/@claude-flow/embeddings/src/rrf.ts` (140 LoC, zero deps). New MCP tool `embeddings_search_text_ensemble` (N text variants + name + k → fused top-k) composes `search_text_batch` + `reciprocalRankFusion` for one-call ensemble RAG. Surfaces per-list ranks for transparency + `listOccurrences` + per-query summary. Per-stage latency (`embeddingMs/searchMs/fuseMs`) for cost attribution. Per-query failures degrade to empty contributions rather than aborting the ensemble. Optional `listWeights` for biased ensembles (e.g. weight original query 2× over reformulations). 15 unit tests cover hand-computed SIGIR-2009 scores, multi-list fusion (items in more lists outrank items in one), kRrf parameter effects, listWeights bias, payload preservation (from first appearance), tie-break determinism (alphabetical on id), validation. CI gate (`cli-search-text-ensemble-smoke`) wired — drives init → router build → 3-variant ensemble → weighted ensemble → kRrf variants → validation (empty texts, bad weight length) → missing-handle path. Asserts score monotone non-increasing + ranks-length-matches-queryCount invariants.
- [ ] **Phase 3b (promoted from Phase 6)** — `@ruvector/attention@2.2.2` integration. Was deferred over native-bindings concerns; probed footprint = **1.2 MB total install**, surface includes `flashAttention`, `multiHeadAttention`, `hyperbolicAttention(query, keys, values, curvature?)`, plus Poincaré ball ops (`expMap`, `logMap`, `mobiusAddition`, `projectToPoincareBall`, `poincareDistance`). Replaces hand-rolled `src/hyperbolic.ts` with a real WASM/native-backed implementation. Concrete plan:
  - Add a `HyperbolicEmbeddingTransform` helper that wraps `@ruvector/attention`'s Poincaré ops
  - Mark `src/hyperbolic.ts` functions as `@deprecated` with a 1:1 migration table
  - Optional peer dep + fallback to current hand-rolled impl when not installed
- [ ] Phase 4 — Deprecate Xenova, real RVF adapter
- [ ] Phase 5 — ruvector MCP sidecar
- [ ] **Phase 5b (new)** — `@ruvector/diskann@0.1.0` evaluation as the searchable-cache backing for billion-scale agent fleets (alongside HNSW). DiskANN/Vamana keeps the index on SSD with product-quantization, complementary to RaBitQ (RAM compression) and HNSW (in-RAM ANN).

## Success metrics (rolled up)

| Metric | Today | Target | Phase |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| ONNX embedding latency (per call, all-MiniLM-L6-v2) | baseline | -20% | 1 |
| Embeddings install footprint (`node_modules/`) | baseline | -30% | 1 |
| Cache hit recall (near-duplicate queries) | 0 (exact match only) | ≥0.95 | 2 |
| Cache insert throughput | baseline (sql.js) | ≥10k/sec | 2 |
| Vector memory per entry | 4×N bytes (float32) | N/8 bytes (RaBitQ) | 3 |
| Quantized retrieval recall | n/a | ≥0.95 (RaBitQ), ≥0.98 (int8) | 3 |
| `RvfEmbeddingService` honesty | hash-based placeholder | real RVF backing | 4 |
| Embedding-heavy MCP cost | baseline | -30% | 5 |

## Open questions

1. **Should `RuvectorOnnxEmbeddingService` replace `AgenticFlowEmbeddingService`?** Both target ONNX. agentic-flow has a different model catalog + caching story. Keep both for now; let usage decide.
2. **Cache migration semantics for Phase 2.** Lazy-rebuild on first lookup, or eager batch migrate at startup? Likely lazy; track via a CI smoke that asserts old cache files don't break the new path.
3. **RaBitQ rerank strategy.** Always rerank top-K with full precision, or only when the top-1 score is below a confidence threshold? Cost vs recall tradeoff.
